# Introduction

# Background and Related Work

# Datasets

Training a supervised classification model requires access to a
dataset of labelled examples. Given the relative infrequency of
fraudulent events to legitimate cases, it is all the more necessary
that fraud classification projects require large amounts of data in
order to provide a modest number of fraudulent examples from which the
model can learn.

Considering the sensitive nature of fraud investigations, it is not
surprising to find that no such data is available in the public
domain. We propose a method for simulating anomalous business
ownership structures using data that is available to the public.

## People with Significant Control Register

Since 2016, it has been a requirement for all businesses in the United
Kingdom to declare People of Significant Control. This includes
all shareholders with ownership greater than 25%, any
persons with more than 25% of voting rights, and any person with the
right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors
