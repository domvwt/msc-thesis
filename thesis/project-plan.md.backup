# Anomaly Detection in Graphs -- Project Plan

## Notes

- Anomaly detection in this case is treated as an **inductive** exercise rather than **transductive**
	+ data is made available in periodic full snapshots as opposed to real-time / streaming updates
	+ possible to apply the trained models to unseen data, however performance is contingent on similarity of generating processes, which may prove to be specific to territories and jurisdictions.
- Explainability
	+ what is available for graph models?
	+ how useful are the results for real world investigations without interpretation?
- Class imbalance
	+ loss is multiplied by 10 for anomalous nodes
equalise their importance in model training
