	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07178},
	abstract = {Anomalies represent rare observations (e.g., data records or events) that deviate significantly from others. Over several decades, research on anomaly mining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these occurrences in a wide range of disciplines. Anomaly detection, which aims to identify rare observations, is among the most vital tasks in the world, and has shown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusion, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space and inherently overlooks the relational information in real-world data. Graphs have been prevalently used to represent the structural information, which raises the graph anomaly detection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a database/set of graphs. However, conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem well because of the complexity of graph data. For the advent of deep learning, graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly detection. We compile open-sourced implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide affluent resources for future studies. More importantly, we highlight twelve extensive future research directions according to our survey results covering unsolved and emerging research problems and real-world applications. With this survey, our goal is to create a "one-stop-shop" that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph anomaly detection using deep learning.},

	abstract = {Graphs, such as social networks, word co-occurrence networks, and communication networks, occur naturally in various real-world applications. Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and diﬀerent patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to perform the analysis. Recently, methods which use the representation of graph nodes in vector space have gained traction from the research community. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We ﬁrst introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions. We ﬁnally present the open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods, available at https://github.com/palash1992/GEM), which provides all presented algorithms within a uniﬁed interface to foster and facilitate research on the topic.},

These nefarious industries rely on sophisticated money laundering schemes to operate. Despite tremendous resources dedicated to anti-money laundering (AML) only a tiny fraction of illicit activity is prevented. The research community can help. In this brief paper, we map the structural and behavioral dynamics driving the technical challenge. We review AML methods, current and emergent. We provide a first look at scalable graph convolutional neural networks for forensic analysis of financial data, which is massive, dense, and dynamic. We report preliminary experimental results using a large synthetic graph (1M nodes, 9M edges) generated by a data simulator we created called AMLSim. We consider opportunities for high performance efficiency, in terms of computation and memory, and we share results from a simple graph compression experiment. Our results support our working hypothesis that graph deep learning for AML bears great promise in the fight against criminal financial activity.},

	abstract = {Anti-money laundering (AML) regulations play a critical role in safeguarding financial systems, but bear high costs for institutions and drive financial exclusion for those on the socioeconomic and international margins. The advent of cryptocurrency has introduced an intriguing paradox: pseudonymity allows criminals to hide in plain sight, but open data gives more power to investigators and enables the crowdsourcing of forensic analysis. Meanwhile advances in learning algorithms show great promise for the AML toolkit. In this workshop tutorial, we motivate the opportunity to reconcile the cause of safety with that of financial inclusion. We contribute the Elliptic Data Set, a time series graph of over 200K Bitcoin transactions (nodes), 234K directed payment flows (edges), and 166 node features, including ones based on non-public data; to our knowledge, this is the largest labelled transaction data set publicly available in any cryptocurrency. We share results from a binary classification task predicting illicit transactions using variations of Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), with GCN being of special interest as an emergent new method for capturing relational information. The results show the superiority of Random Forest (RF), but also invite algorithmic work to combine the respective powers of RF and graph methods. Lastly, we consider visualization for analysis and explainability, which is difficult given the size and dynamism of real-world transaction graphs, and we offer a simple prototype capable of navigating the graph and observing model performance on illicit activity over time. With this tutorial and data set, we hope to a) invite feedback in support of our ongoing inquiry, and b) inspire others to work on this societally important challenge.},

Although we have a labeled real dataset, our target is not only to obtain relevant results on it, but also on random graphs in which typical anomaly patterns have been injected. So, we want simultaneously adequacy to the real data and robustness. Our method is based on designing new features; the most important are those resulting from the reduced egonet, which is the subgraph that remains from an egonet after eliminating the nodes connected with a single edge to the center; another feature is built by appealing to random walks and serves as indicator of circular flows. Our features are added to usual egonet features and a general anomaly detection algorithm, in our case Isolation Forest, serves to detect the anomalies. Experiments on the real data and a comprehensive set of synthetic data show that our approach is adequate, robust and better than some previous methods.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

	abstract = {Financial crime is a large and growing problem, in some way touching almost every financial institution. Financial institutions are the front line in the war against financial crime and accordingly, must devote substantial human and technology resources to this effort. Current processes to detect financial misconduct have limitations in their ability to effectively differentiate between malicious behavior and ordinary financial activity. These limitations tend to result in gross over-reporting of suspicious activity that necessitate time-intensive and costly manual review. Advances in technology used in this domain, including machine learning based approaches, can improve upon the effectiveness of financial institutions' existing processes, however, a key challenge that most financial institutions continue to face is that they address financial crimes in isolation without any insight from other firms. Where financial institutions address financial crimes through the lens of their own firm, perpetrators may devise sophisticated strategies that may span across institutions and geographies. Financial institutions continue to work relentlessly to advance their capabilities, forming partnerships across institutions to share insights, patterns and capabilities. These public-private partnerships are subject to stringent regulatory and data privacy requirements, thereby making it difficult to rely on traditional technology solutions. In this paper, we propose a methodology to share key information across institutions by using a federated graph learning platform that enables us to build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning and also graph learning approaches. We demonstrated that our federated model outperforms local model by 20\% with the UK FCA TechSprint data set. This new platform opens up a door to efficiently detecting global money laundering activity.},

	abstract = {Detecting anomalies in data is a vital task, with numerous high-impact applications in areas such as security, finance, health care, and law enforcement. While numerous techniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies in unstructured collections of multi-dimensional points, with graph data becoming ubiquitous, techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs have long-range correlations, a suite of novel technology has been developed for anomaly detection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we give a general framework for the algorithms categorized under various settings: unsupervised versus (semi-)supervised approaches, for static versus dynamic graphs, for attributed versus plain graphs. We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, generality, and robustness aspects of the methods. What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly attribution and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the ‘why’, of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open theoretical and practical challenges in the field.},

@misc{li_inference_2018,
	title = {Inference in heterogeneous networks},
	abstract = {Last two decades have seen a surge of interests in approaches that leverage network structure in machine learning models. For many networks, not only the connections of the network but also the network attributes, such as node attributes and dyadic attributes, are observed. This heterogeneity in networks raises new challenges for the inference problem in networks.

This dissertation discusses how to handle the heterogeneous networks for different ma- chine learning applications, namely community detection, node classification, and node representation learning. For community detection in network with node attributes, we introduce a mathematical approach that combines topology information and nodes at- tributes. The algorithm explores the correlation between node attributes and community assignment, and uses the diversity of dyadic attributes induced by different types of nodes to improve performance as well. We also study node classification problem in a transaction network, where rich information of node and edge is available, within Markov random field framework. We present a novel algorithm that automatically learns node prior and edge potential in the Markov random field, hence results in better classification. Finally, we generalize deepwalk to incorporate the dyadic attributes in network representation learning by biasing the random walk sampling procedure in deepwalk. The algorithm learns the sampling weights in a data driven manner and constructs a proper proximity measure based on the dyadic attributes.},

	abstract = {Money laundering refers to activities pertaining to hiding the true income, evading taxes, or converting illegally earned money for normal use. These activities are often performed through shell companies that masquerade as real companies but where actual the purpose is to launder money. Shell companies are used in all the three phases of money laundering, namely, placement, layering, and integration, often simultaneously. In this paper, we aim to identify shell companies. We propose to use only bank transactions since that is easily available. In particular, we look at all incoming and outgoing transactions from a particular bank account along with its various attributes, and use anomaly detection techniques to identify the accounts that pertain to shell companies. Our aim is to create an initial list of potential shell company candidates which can be investigated by financial experts later. Due to lack of real data, we propose a banking transactions simulator (BTS) to simulate both honest as well as shell company transactions by studying a host of actual real-world fraud cases. We apply anomaly detection algorithms to detect candidate shell companies. Results indicate that we are able to identify the shell companies with a high degree of precision and recall.1},

So, we want simultaneously adequacy to the real data and robustness. Our method is based on designing new features; the most important are those resulting from the reduced egonet, which is the subgraph that remains from an egonet after eliminating the nodes connected with a single edge to the center; another feature is built by appealing to random walks and serves as indicator of circular flows. Our features are added to usual egonet features and a general anomaly detection algorithm, in our case Isolation Forest, serves to detect the anomalies.

Our underlying hypothesis is community based fraud detection: an account (holder) performs normal or trusted transactions within a community that is " local " to the account. We explore several notions of community based on graph properties. Our results show that properties such as shortest distance between transaction endpoints, whether they are in the same strongly connected component, whether the destination has high page rank, etc., provide excellent discriminators of fraudulent and normal transactions whereas traditional social network analysis yields poor results. Evaluation on a large dataset from a European bank shows that such methods can substantially reduce false positives in traditional fraud scoring. We show that classifiers built purely out of graph properties are very promising, with high AUC, and can complement existing fraud detection approaches.},

This database contained the financial operations linked to the factoring business, together with other useful information about the company clients. We propose a new approach to sort and map relational data and present predictive models – based on network metrics – to assess risk profiles of clients involved in the factoring business. We find that risk profiles can be predicted by using social network metrics. In our dataset, the most dangerous social actors deal with bigger or more frequent financial operations; they are more peripheral in the transactions network; they mediate transactions across different economic sectors and operate in riskier countries or Italian regions. Finally, to spot potential clusters of criminals, we propose a visual analysis of the tacit links existing among different companies who share the same owner or representative. Our findings show the importance of using a network-based approach when looking for suspicious financial operations and potential criminals.},

	abstract = {Attributed networks are ubiquitous and form a critical component of modern information infrastructure, where additional node attributes complement the raw network structure in knowledge discovery. Recently, detecting anomalous nodes on attributed networks has attracted an increasing amount of research attention, with broad applications in various high-impact domains, such as cybersecurity, ﬁnance, and healthcare. Most of the existing attempts, however, tackle the problem with shallow learning mechanisms by ego-network or community analysis, or through subspace selection. Undoubtedly, these models cannot fully address the computational challenges on attributed networks. For example, they often suﬀer from the network sparsity and data nonlinearity issues, and fail to capture the complex interactions between diﬀerent information modalities, thus negatively impact the performance of anomaly detection. To tackle the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we study the anomaly detection problem on attributed networks by developing a novel deep model. In particular, our proposed deep model: (1) explicitly models the topological structure and nodal attributes seamlessly for node embedding learning with the prevalent graph convolutional network (GCN); and (2) is customized to address the anomaly detection problem by virtue of deep autoencoder that leverages the learned embeddings to reconstruct the original data. The synergy between GCN and autoencoder enables us to spot anomalies by measuring the reconstruction errors of nodes from both the structure and the attribute perspectives. Extensive experiments on real-world attributed network datasets demonstrate the eﬃcacy of our proposed algorithm.},

We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes.

Traditional approaches cope with graphical data structures using a preprocessing phase which transforms the graphs into a set of flat vectors.

	abstract = {The explosion of modeling complex systems using attributed networks boosts the research on anomaly detection in such networks, which can be applied in various high-impact domains. Many existing attempts, however, do not seriously tackle the inherent multi-view property in attribute space but concatenate multiple views into a single feature vector, which inevitably ignores the incompatibility between heterogeneous views caused by their own statistical properties. Actually, the distinct but complementary information brought by multi-view data promises the potential for more effective anomaly detection than the efforts only based on single-view data. Furthermore, the abnormal patterns naturally behave diversely in different views, which coincides with people’s desire to discover specific abnormality according to their preferences for views (attributes). Most existing methods cannot adapt to people’s requirements as they fail to consider the idiosyncrasy of user preferences. Therefore, we propose a multi-view framework \textsc{Alarm} to incorporate user preferences into anomaly detection and simultaneously tackle heterogeneous attribute characteristics through multiple graph encoders and a well-designed aggregator that supports self-learning and user-guided learning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, e.g., Disney, Books, and Enron, corroborate the improvement of \textsc{Alarm} in detection accuracy evaluated by the AUC metric and its effectiveness in supporting user-oriented anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection aims to distinguish observations that are rare and different from the majority. While most existing algorithms assume that instances are i.i.d., in many practical scenarios, links describing instance-to-instance dependencies and interactions are available. Such systems are called attributed networks. Anomaly detection in attributed networks has various applications such as monitoring suspicious accounts in social media and financial fraud in transaction networks. However, it remains a challenging task since the definition of anomaly becomes more complicated and topological structures are heterogeneous with nodal attributes. In this paper, we propose a spectral convolution and deconvolution based framework -- SpecAE, to project the attributed network into a tailored space to detect global and community anomalies. SpecAE leverages Laplacian sharpening to amplify the distances between representations of anomalies and the ones of the majority. The learned representations along with reconstruction errors are combined with a density estimation model to perform the detection. They are trained jointly as an end-to-end framework. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpecAE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, recommender system has become an indispensable function in all e-commerce platforms. The review rating data for a recommender system typically comes from open platforms, which may attract a group of malicious users to deliberately insert fake feedback in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their favour. The presence of such attacks may violate modeling assumptions that high-quality data is always available and these data truly reflect users' interests and preferences. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to construct a robust recommender system that is able to generate stable recommendations even in the presence of shilling attacks. In this paper, we propose GraphRfi - a GCN-based user representation learning framework to perform robust recommendation and fraudster detection in a unified way. In its end-to-end learning process, the probability of a user being identified as a fraudster in the fraudster detection component automatically determines the contribution of this user's rating data in the recommendation component; while the prediction error outputted in the recommendation component acts as an important feature in the fraudster detection component. Thus, these two components can mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the experimental results show the superiority of our GraphRfi in the two tasks - robust rating prediction and fraudster detection. Furthermore, the proposed GraphRfi is validated to be more robust to the various types of shilling attacks over the state-of-the-art recommender systems.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of financial services, fraud detection has been a very important problem to guarantee a healthy environment for both users and providers. Conventional solutions for fraud detection mainly use some rule-based methods or distract some features manually to perform prediction. However, in financial services, users have rich interactions and they themselves always show multifaceted information. These data form a large multiview network, which is not fully exploited by conventional methods. Additionally, among the network, only very few of the users are labelled, which also poses a great challenge for only utilizing labeled data to achieve a satisfied performance on fraud detection. To address the problem, we expand the labeled data through their social relations to get the unlabeled data and propose a semi-supervised attentive graph neural network, namedSemiGNN to utilize the multi-view labeled and unlabeled data for fraud detection. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism to better correlate different neighbors and different views. Simultaneously, the attention mechanism can make the model interpretable and tell what are the important factors for the fraud and why the users are predicted as fraud. Experimentally, we conduct the prediction task on the users of Alipay, one of the largest third-party online and offline cashless payment platform serving more than 4 hundreds of million users in China. By utilizing the social relations and the user attributes, our method can achieve a better accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods on two tasks. Moreover, the interpretable results also give interesting intuitions regarding the tasks.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the "LINE," which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available online.},

	abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},
