	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07178},
	abstract = {Anomalies represent rare observations (e.g., data records or events) that deviate significantly from others. Over several decades, research on anomaly mining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these occurrences in a wide range of disciplines. Anomaly detection, which aims to identify rare observations, is among the most vital tasks in the world, and has shown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusion, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space and inherently overlooks the relational information in real-world data. Graphs have been prevalently used to represent the structural information, which raises the graph anomaly detection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a database/set of graphs. However, conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem well because of the complexity of graph data. For the advent of deep learning, graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly detection. We compile open-sourced implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide affluent resources for future studies. More importantly, we highlight twelve extensive future research directions according to our survey results covering unsolved and emerging research problems and real-world applications. With this survey, our goal is to create a "one-stop-shop" that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph anomaly detection using deep learning.},

	abstract = {Graphs, such as social networks, word co-occurrence networks, and communication networks, occur naturally in various real-world applications. Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and diﬀerent patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to perform the analysis. Recently, methods which use the representation of graph nodes in vector space have gained traction from the research community. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We ﬁrst introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions. We ﬁnally present the open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods, available at https://github.com/palash1992/GEM), which provides all presented algorithms within a uniﬁed interface to foster and facilitate research on the topic.},
