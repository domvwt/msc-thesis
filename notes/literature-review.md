## [A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Anomaly Detection with Deep Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xm9lkkx6DkkSsdIKTHrZRQmeoCo5LpON/view?usp=sharing)

### Types of Graph

- Plain Graph
    - Static graph that consists of nodes and edges.
- Attributed Graph
    - Static graph that consists of nodes and edges, plus a set of node features X.
- Dynamic Graph
    - A set of nodes and edges that changes over time.

### Anomalous Node Detection

- Global Anomalies
    - Consider only the node attributes.
    - Nodes that are significantly different to all others in the graph.
- Structural Anomalies
    - Consider only the graph structural information.
    - Nodes that have atypical connection patterns.
- Community Anomalies
    - Consider both node attributes and graph structural information.
    - Nodes that have anomalous attributes compared to their neighbours.
