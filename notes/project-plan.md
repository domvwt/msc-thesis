# Anomaly Detection in Graphs -- Project Plan

# IDEAS

- try different order invariant aggregation functions in GNN (sum, mean, median, std...)
    - sum
    - mean
    - median
    - std
    - harmonic mean
- can we predict node features using a GNN? Where predictions are wrong can we identify anomalous nodes?
    - industry
    - number of directors
    - degree
    - other properties?
- GraphSAGE vs GraphMAGE vs GIN 

## Key Milestones

### Propose research topic

Need to submit the following

- a putative project title
- your main project aim or aims
- your project question(s) or possibly hypothesis
- any thoughts you have now about methodology
- any thoughts you have now about data you would use.
